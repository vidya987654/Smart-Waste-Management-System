# ♻️ Smart Waste Management System for Metropolitan Cities

> **Industry-level IoT + AI web platform for intelligent urban waste monitoring, alert management, and route optimization — built for Pune Metropolitan Region.**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Smart Waste Management System (SWMS)** is an advanced full-stack web application that simulates a real-world IoT-powered waste monitoring platform for metropolitan cities. It integrates real-time bin fill-level tracking, AI-based route optimization, live analytics, and a REST API for IoT device connectivity.

Built using **Python Flask**, **Leaflet.js maps**, **Chart.js analytics**, and a **professional dark-sidebar UI**, this project demonstrates an end-to-end smart city solution aligned with **UN SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)**.

## 📡 IoT Sensor Simulation

Each bin has a **time-seeded fill level generator** that simulates ultrasonic distance sensor readings:

```python
def get_fill_level(bin_id):
    random.seed(int(bin_id[-3:]) + datetime.now().hour * 7)
    base = random.randint(20, 95)
    return min(100, max(5, base + noise))
```

This ensures fill levels are consistent within each hour (realistic IoT behavior) and change across hours (simulating actual waste accumulation).

## 🤖 Route Optimization Algorithm

The system uses a **Greedy Nearest-Neighbour** algorithm to compute optimal truck collection routes:

```python
def greedy_route(bins_to_collect):
    route = []
    current = DEPOT
    remaining = bins_to_collect[:]
    while remaining:
        nearest = min(remaining, key=lambda b: haversine(...))
        route.append(nearest)
        current = nearest
    return route
```

Distance is calculated using the **Haversine Formula** for accurate GPS-based distance computation.
